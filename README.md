# Naraka-AI

## Purpose
  Naraka Bladepoint is a game that is not big in th western world but has become a central hub for competitive gamers alike most notably in China and Vietnam. boasting a 40 million player base and quite possible been called "the most difficult game ever". Pro play has become a spectacle for many to gaze in awe. Many are trying to build their own strategies for winning competitive events and be able to say they won the "Herald's Trial". Because of this many veteran players have tried to test and rationalize developing metas. 
  The purpose of this code is to be both an informative experience for basic low level linear regressions and also possibly providing an edge to driven players in deducing the most important objectives in competitive play. Is it fighting for the 3v3 Yang fights? winning off spawn? Or is it simply ratting?
  Hopefully this code will offer some assistance in users testing various versions and combinations of stats to find a good fit for them

## How to install
  ### preparations
    must have numpy and matplotlib installed.

    to do this got to your CMD or terminal for MAC and type 
      "pip3 install numpy matplotlib"

  ### Step 1
    Please download the entire package folder from the github
    
  ### Step 2
    go to the main.py folder and run script

## Features
  Working on getting first version out which should include typing in specific stats in any order or combination and retrieve a guess of what the ave. points that game would be. this would be by getting a manual calculation of the least squares regressions of training data and using it on stats that you provide.
